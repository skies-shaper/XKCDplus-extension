# Welcome to my XKCD website-reader extension! 
It has lots of fun features, like showing the title text below comics, and a button to go to the wiki! 
## Using it on your very own computer
Download all the code using the code dropdown menu, downloading everything as a zip. Unzip that.
To use it as an extension, open chrome://extensions, turn on 'developer mode', and press 'load unpacked' to use this!
## Upcoming features: 
-I will eventually add a way to search favorited comics and so forth
